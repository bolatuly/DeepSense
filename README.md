# User-activity classification for paper "Discovering User-context in Indoor Space".

We discover user-context in indoor space by combining activity and location context for user. 

This code is forked from [yscacaca/DeepSense](https://github.com/yscacaca/DeepSense) and modified for user-activity classification purpose in our project. Also, you can see our app for [data collection](https://github.com/STEMLab/android_sensor_reader) and [data preprocessing](https://github.com/bolatuly/HHAR-Data-Process).

Instructions:
1. Set local paths to your preprocessed data.
2. Run ``` deepSense_HHAR_tf.py ``` to classify user actions. 

Requirements for python version and tensorflow can be found in main repository of [DeepSense](https://github.com/yscacaca/DeepSense).
